  <p>
    Our contract with LexisNexis allows us to offer unrestricted access to members of the Harvard community.
  </p>
  <p>
    To qualify, you must:
  </p>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>be a member of the Harvard community;</li>
    <li>have a harvard.edu email address;</li>
    <li>access the site from a Harvard IP address.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="alert alert-danger">
    <strong>Important:</strong> unrestricted access requires you to enter a contract between you, the Harvard
    Law School Library, and LexisNexis. <strong>The contract permits LexisNexis to sue you personally
    if you use caselaw for commercial or non-research purposes or if you share it with others.</strong>
    Please read the contract carefully and consider whether full unrestricted
    access is necessary for your project. CAP provides all users with access to 500 cases per day, unlimited metadata,
    and bulk data from whitelisted jurisdictions without entering this contract.
